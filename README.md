# AChareun - Frontend Developer

Hi! I'm a 24 years old, former psychology student from Argentina, who is now following a career as a web developer. 

Although I'm looking for my first job as a developer, I'm still fully committed to my formation, mainly following the fullstack web-development course of **[r/argentinaprograma](https://argentinaprograma.com/):** but also complementing it with other minor courses and sources.

Nowadays I'm living in Urdinarrain, Entre RÃ­os, but I'm willing to relocate to CABA.

## More About Me

I love playing videogames and I'm an esports enthusiast (mostly DOTA and AoE); music is my companion in almost all I do during the day, although I'm pretty bad at everything related to it; and I really enjoy watching tv series and movies but probably didn't see that classic one you consider essential.

I live with my younger sister and my cat, Tangerina, who is less of a pet and more of an extra roommate that likes to behave badly but also cuddle for an eternity (you know, a normal cat).
