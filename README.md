# AChareun - Web Developer

Hi! I'm a 25 years old, former psychology student from Argentina, who is now following a career as a developer.

I'm open to job offers/opportunities and still fully committed to my formation: mainly following the fullstack web-development course of **[r/argentinaprograma](https://argentinaprograma.com/):** but also complementing it with other minor courses and sources.

Nowadays I'm living in Urdinarrain, Entre RÃ­os, but I'm willing to relocate to CABA.

## More About Me

I'm kind of a compulsive googler so I figured out I could be a decent developer. I also love to learn and read about new and interesting things so documentation is always received with wide open arms. I don't have a Computer Science background or anything like that, so I'm always trying to 'catch up'.

I love playing videogames and I'm an esports enthusiast (mostly DOTA and AoE); music is my companion in almost all I do during the day, although I'm pretty bad at everything related to it; and I really enjoy watching tv series and movies but probably didn't see that classic one you consider essential.

I have a cat, Tangerina, who is less of a pet and more of an extra roommate that likes to behave badly but also cuddle for an eternity (you know, a normal cat).
